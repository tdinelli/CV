% Most of the contributions can be found at
% \href{https://github.com/tdinelli}{https://github.com/tdinelli}. I have been one of the
% main developer and maintainer of the \href{https://sciexpem.polimi.it/}{SciExpeM}
% ecosystem. I was an active contributor to the development of
% \href{https://www.opensmokepp.polimi.it/}{OpenSMOKE++}. Including significant
% enhancements to the core library, as well as the development of functionality for the
% ideal reactor and one-dimensional flame solvers,
% \href{https://www.opensmokepp.polimi.it/}{DoctorSMOKE++} and
% \href{https://github.com/burn-research/OptiSMOKE_toolbox}{OptiSMOKE++}. I have developed
% a Python interface,
% \href{https://github.com/tdinelli/OpenSMOKEpp_Interfaces}{OpenSMOKEpp\_Intrefaces}, which
% exposes the core functionality of the OpenSMOKE++ library. In addition, I have created a
% comprehensive post-processing suite,
% \href{https://github.com/tdinelli/pySMOKEPostProcessor}{pySMOKEPostProcessor} for gas
% phase kinetic simulations.
My research contributions are available via my
\href{https://github.com/tdinelli}{GitHub}. As one of the principal developers of the
\href{https://sciexpem.polimi.it/}{SciExpeM} ecosystem, I enhanced the
\href{https://www.opensmokepp.polimi.it/}{OpenSMOKE++} framework through core
architecture improvements and implementation of numerical solvers for reactors and flame
configurations. I extended OpenSMOKE++ by further developing
\href{https://www.opensmokepp.polimi.it/}{DoctorSMOKE++} and
\href{https://github.com/burn-research/OptiSMOKE_toolbox}{OptiSMOKE++}. Additionally, I
created
\href{https://github.com/tdinelli/OpenSMOKEpp_Interfaces}{OpenSMOKEpp\_Interfaces}, a
Python interface for OpenSMOKE++, and
\href{https://github.com/tdinelli/pySMOKEPostProcessor}{pySMOKEPostProcessor}, a
post-processing suite for gas-phase kinetic simulations.
