{\bf Software---}
I have contributed to several scientific software tools during my research work. My
contributions are available via my \href{https://github.com/tdinelli}{GitHub}. During my
PhD, I collaborated with Edoardo Ramalli as developers of the
\href{https://sciexpem.polimi.it/}{SciExpeM} ecosystem, which integrates various
scientific programs for experimental research. As part of this work, I helped enhance the
\href{https://www.opensmokepp.polimi.it/}{OpenSMOKE++} library and developed
functionalities for reactor and flame solvers, including also
\href{https://www.opensmokepp.polimi.it/}{DoctorSMOKE++} and
\href{https://github.com/burn-research/OptiSMOKE_toolbox}{OptiSMOKE++}. To make these
tools more accessible, I created
\href{https://github.com/tdinelli/OpenSMOKEpp_Interfaces}{OpenSMOKEpp\_Interfaces},
providing Python bindings to the core library. Additionally, I developed
\href{https://github.com/tdinelli/pySMOKEPostProcessor}{pySMOKEPostProcessor} for
analyzing and visualizing simulation data. Currently, I am working on the CurveMatching
framework, which uses functional data analysis techniques for chemical kinetic
applications.
