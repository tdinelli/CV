I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at \polimi, affiliated with the Department of Chemistry,
Materials, and Chemical Engineering Giulio Natta. My research takes place within the
CRECK modeling laboratory, under the supervision of Professor Alessandro Stagni. My Ph.D.
work centers on enhancing chemical kinetics models for predicting combustion and
pyrolysis behaviors of complex fuels using data-driven methods.
